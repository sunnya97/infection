# infection
Please view video instructions here:  https://youtu.be/qg43-1xtjyA

EDIT:  One feature I forgot to mention in the video is the ability to expand the infection.  So for example, if you originally infected 3 people, and then want to get a total of 10 people, it wouldn't make sense to recalculate a new set of 10 people to infect.  Rather, it should find the best set of 7 additional people to infect beyond the already infected.
